# Onion Architecture

## Overview

Onion Architecture is a software architecture pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns, scalability, and testability. It is structured around layers that form an "onion," with the core being at the center and external dependencies at the outer layers. This architecture is particularly useful for building maintainable and testable enterprise applications.

## Key Layers

1. **Core (Domain Layer)**:
   - This is the innermost layer and contains the core business logic and domain entities.
   - It is independent of any external dependencies such as databases or UI frameworks.
   - Key components:
     - Domain Entities
     - Domain Services
     - Business Rules
     
2. **Application Layer**:
   - Contains the application logic that interacts with the domain layer.
   - Defines service interfaces, use cases, and handles application workflows.
   - It is dependent on the domain layer but not on any external layers.
   - Key components:
     - Use Cases
     - Application Services
     
3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Responsible for implementing external dependencies like data access, messaging, and other I/O operations.
   - This layer depends on both the application and domain layers.
   - Key components:
     - Repositories
     - Data Access Implementations
     - Third-Party Integrations
     
4. **Presentation Layer**:
   - The outermost layer, which deals with user interfaces, APIs, and other presentation concerns.
   - It interacts with the application layer to present data to the user.
   - Key components:
     - Controllers
     - Views
     - API Endpoints

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, making the system more maintainable.
- **Testability**: The core business logic can be tested in isolation from external dependencies.
- **Flexibility**: Changes in one layer have minimal impact on other layers, allowing for easy updates and scaling.
- **Maintainability**: The clear separation of responsibilities results in a codebase that is easier to understand and maintain.
